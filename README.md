## Resource Hider

Resource Hider is MODX Revolution component which allows you to hide/show some resources from the back-end tree.
You can either hide all resources from a given parent, or hand-pick wich resource to hide.
This makes use of hide_children_in_tree & show_in_tree columns.

NOTE : Be sure you know what you do, you can easily lose access to your resources from the back-end! (but the data is
NOT lost!)

## Installation

* Install from package manager
* Enjoy :)

## Information

ResourceHider is currently (and always should be) in constant development.
