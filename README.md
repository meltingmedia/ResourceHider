## Resource Hider

Resource Hider is MODX Revolution component which allows you to hide/show some resources from the back-end tree.
You can either hide all resources from a given parent, or hand-pick which resource to hide.
This makes use of hide_children_in_tree & show_in_tree columns.

NOTE : You can easily restore your resources with the Custom Manager Page

Since v0.2.x, Resource Hider is shipped with a Custom Resource Class to help your users manage hidden children.
